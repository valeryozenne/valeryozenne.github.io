# ReScience C website

The ReScience C website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the amazing [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

After commiting some changes to the `sources` branch, you'll need to run the
[publish.sh](publish.sh) script to publish the site at
[valeryozenne.github.io](valeryozenne.github.io).
