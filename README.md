# Val√©ry Ozenne personal website

The website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

After commiting some changes to the `sources` branch, you'll need to run the
[publish.sh](publish.sh) script to publish the site at
[valeryozenne.github.io](valeryozenne.github.io).

The website is inspired at 200% by the personal website of [Nicolas Rougier](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/)
